        <p className="para">Today, forging certificates has become a business tumbling from the need/want of
          the people for employment. Graduates with legitimate certificates/degrees are denied
          job opportunities by the holders of these forged credentials. To address this problem,
          we have proposed a certificate verification system. Although the existing
          systems can solve some of the major problems such as accessing student's records with the
          provision of a central database to manage these records electronically. However, the system
          can easily be hacked and manipulated since it is mostly available on centralized servers.
          Blockchain is decentralized shared database so that no single person or group has controlâ€”instead,
          all users collectively retain control.<br/>
          With a unique approach, we not only help you create stunning certificates but also facilitate the entire process.
          Simply input the event details along with the respective year.
          Our seamless system will securely transmit your information to the relevant board. Once verified, the board will generate
          your certificate and post it directly to your user profile.<br/>
          We take pride in streamlining this process, ensuring accuracy, security, and convenience. Join us in celebrating your
          academic milestones while we handle the technicalities, making your certificate procurement experience smooth and rewarding.
          Your achievements deserve to be showcased, and we're here to make it happen!
