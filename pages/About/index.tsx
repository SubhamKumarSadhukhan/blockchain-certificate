      <p className="align-middle">Today, forging certificates has become a business tumbling from the need/want of
        the people for employment. Graduates with legitimate certificates/degrees are denied
        job opportunities by the holders of these forged credentials. To address this problem,
        we have proposed a certificate verification system. Although the existing
        systems can solve some of the major problems such as accessing student's records with the
        provision of a central database to manage these records electronically. However, the system
        can easily be hacked and manipulated since it is mostly available on centralized servers.
        Blockchain is decentralized shared database so that no single person or group has controlâ€”instead,
        all users collectively retain control.</p>
